# Strain Api

I've seen it done before but I wanna do it again.
A collection of cannabis strains, defined by name, description, variety, and thc content.

/strains will get you a collection of all strains
/strains/{id} will get you one strain
/strains [POST] will let you create a strain
/strains/{id} [PATCH] will let you update a strain, even if you only send one parameter in your request
/strains/{id} [DELETE] will, you know.

Have fun!
